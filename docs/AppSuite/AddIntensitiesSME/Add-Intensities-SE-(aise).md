# Introduction

_This program is available on Muscle X version 1.7 or higher_

Add Intensities Single Experiment (former Image Merger) is a program which is designed to be used with a series of images with sequential file names taken in a time resolved experiment. It averages a user-selected number of images in an input directory together and saves the new image in an output directory. It does this for the rest of the images in the input directory without user intervention. The user selects an input directory or input h5 file, the number of frames to sum together and an output directory named `aise_results` is created at the root of the input. It is possible to calibrate, average instead of summing, and see the grouped images and their result.
