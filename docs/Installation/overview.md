## Suggested Installation Strategy

1. **Try `pip` (recommended for most Python users)**: Use this if you're comfortable with Python virtual environments and want the latest or specific versions.
2. **Use `conda`** if you prefer dependency resolution handled for you.
3. **Use Docker** for a fully isolated, repeatable environment.
4. **Use the Windows or Mac installer** if you are a non-technical user and just want a working GUI.
